OVERVIEW
===================================================================================================================
This pack provides mew mk2 spaceplane parts in the form of engines, fuselage segments and aerodynamic accessories.

THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PRE-RELEASE

INSTALLATION
===================================================================================================================
Delete the previous version of Mk2 Expansion (if any) and place the GameData/Mk2Expansion, Gamedata/Klockheed_martain_Gimbal, Gamedata/CommunityResourcepack, and GameData/InterstellarFuelSwitch directories into Kerbal Space Program/GameData directory.
(Optional) Place the 'Ships' file in your Kerbal Space program folder, and overwrite files if asked to do so. This will add a number of example craft to KSP.
If you don't want nuclear decay with the Rontgen atomic jet, remove the Mk2X_NTJ_Decay MM patch

INSTALLATION NOTE: If you have Ven's Stock Revamp installed and have used the pruner to remove stock files from KSP's asset loader, it has removed a number of files this mod uses. To avoid texture errors, the files Squad/parts/Aero/Wings/Wings.dds; Squad/parts/Aero/Nacelle/Nacelle.dds; Squad/Parts/Command/mk1Cockpit/mk1Cockpit.dds; Squad/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineMainsail/model002.dds; Squad/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineMainsail/model004.dds; Squad/Parts/Engine/liquidEngineLV-N/model003.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/decouplerStackTR-18A/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/dockingPort/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/spotLightMk1/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Electrical/z-400Battery/model000.dds; Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/mk2CrewCabin.dds;Squad/Parts/Electrical/Gigantor-XL/model000;
Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/mk2CrewCabin_LUM.dds will need to be restored, which can be done by renaming the file extension from .dds.bak to .dds
