	description = After hearing complaints that spaceplane engines at times were difficult to use for building rockets and other applications where the ability to radially attach a mk2 fuselage to something was needed, the marketing division felt something should be done. After months of fruitless research into the problem, the radial attach mount was created when a junior engineer asked why they couldn't simply take a structural fuselage cross-section and stick some nails into the side.
