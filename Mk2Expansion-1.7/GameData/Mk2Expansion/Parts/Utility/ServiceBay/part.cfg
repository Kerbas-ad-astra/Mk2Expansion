	description = Ever found yourself wanting to add all those little essential bits to a spaceplane like monoprop tanks, batteries, RTGs, etc. but didn't want to stick them on the outside? With configurable internal tankage for utility resources and stowage space to spare, the Service Bay is the answer to all your problems.
