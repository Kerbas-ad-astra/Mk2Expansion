	description = Invented after a peaceful protest against the lack of spacecraft attachment systems turned violent, the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port allows for the firm attachment of two separate vessels. After docking, vessels can be just as easily undocked. The Mk2 Shielded Docking Port has deployable shutters to protect the port during ascent and a pair of LED docking lights.
